 * KVQ is not really a new library. Performing vector quantization in
 * the feature space requires to have generic vector quantization
 * algorithms in the one hand and a way to handle the feature space
 * not only with dot products, in the other hand. This is available by
 * the vq2 and the gaml libraries (more precisely the gaml::span::* types and functions) respectively.
 *
 * The present package only provide some examples that brings things together.
