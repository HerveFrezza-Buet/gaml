GET LIBSVM FIRST
================

The libsvm library has to be installed first
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). A version greather than
3.17 is required. The gaml-libsvm headers include the libsvm header
file like this

#include <libsvm/svm.h>

and the linking required the flag -lsvm, i.e. libsvm.so has to be in a
standard library directory.


BASIC INSTALLATION
==================

The library is made of headers only. Put all the src/gaml-libsvm*.hpp
files where your compiler can find them, and the basic installation is
done.


UNIX INSTALLATION
=================


For a 32bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make install

For a 64bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_SUFFIX=64
make install

pkg-config is available for compiling your code

g++ -c example.cc `pkg-config --cflags rl`
g++ -o example.bin example.cc `pkg-config --libs rl`
