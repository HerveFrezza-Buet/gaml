BASIC INSTALLATION
==================

The library is made of headers only. Put all the src/gaml*.hpp files
where your compiler can find them, and the basic installation is done.


UNIX INSTALLATION
=================


For a 32bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build

For a 64bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_SUFFIX=64
make install

pkg-config is available for compiling your code

g++ -c example.cc `pkg-config --cflags rl`
g++ -o example.bin example.cc `pkg-config --libs rl`

WINDOWS INSTALLATION

Compilation on Windows (MS VisualC++) is supported.

Untar the archive file.
Then in the project root directory, type:
